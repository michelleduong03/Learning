# Learning 📚

This repository is a collection of my coding experiments, learning projects, and practice snippets as I grow my skills in software development.

## 🌐 What's Inside

### 🖼️ AWS Image Converter

A Python-based tool that converts `.webp` images to `.jpg`, built for an economics class blog that didn’t support WebP format.

- Uses **Python** and **Pillow** for image conversion
- Hosted on **AWS S3** as a static website
- My first hands-on experience with AWS and static site hosting

You can find the project in the `ImageConverter/` folder.

This repo also includes:

- Small programs from online tutorials
- Experiments with new libraries and frameworks
- Notes and code I use to explore different languages, like Python, JavaScript, and more

## ✨ Purpose

This repo helps me track my progress and explore new tools and ideas. It’s not polished or production-ready — just a space to learn by doing.
